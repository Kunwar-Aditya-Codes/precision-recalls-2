        so hard to get organic reach and traffic. The market is vast, and many
        substitutes are available outside, from which we need to promote and
        bring our product into our customer's hands. We can't always depend on
        organic traffic and ways. Sometimes we need to take help from paid
        advertising too. Through Paid promotion, you can promote your business.

        your business. We will learn how to promote our product through paid
        advertising so that more and more customers can come to us.

      <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold my-4'>What is Paid Advertising?</h2>
      <p>
        Let's say you have the best product that can satisfy customers' needs,
        but that product is getting little response and sales due to your
        business's lower reach and brand awareness. In that case, you can take
        help from Digital Advertising. Digital or Paid advertising is an online
        placement of ADs through which you can promote your product. It is run
        on a Bidding system. It is the process where you need to pay to place
        your Ad. In the paid advertising digital marketing paradigm, companies
        compete to have their adverts displayed to internet users. The company
        that is more willing to pay has its ad shown and pays for each click on
        it. Though not all paid advertisements are PPC ads, paid advertising is
        frequently referred to as PPC (pay-per-click) advertising. Paid ADs can
        be seen on numerous platforms, including websites, social media sites,
        and Google search results. (Ltd, n.d.)

        relevancy, and user experience. Typically, the ads with the highest ad
